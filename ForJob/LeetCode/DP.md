# Dynamic Programming Problems

### Longest Increasing Subsequence

[Code](lis-dp.c)


### Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

[Code](climb-stairs.c)

### Maximum Subarray

Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4],the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

**More practice:**

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

[Code](max-sub-arr.c)

### Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character

b) Delete a character

c) Replace a character
